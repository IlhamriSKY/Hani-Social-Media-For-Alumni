# ðŸ˜ƒ Meet Hani (Halo Alumni)
Hani or hello alumni is a website like social media which is specially created for alumni of my alma mater.
Created to share information among alumni, such as event information, job vacancies, alumni books, campus news and other information. 
This project will continue to be developed, there are many features that need to be added and improved. 

# ðŸ’« Features 
Hani was developed inspired by the old facebook style, like social media in general,
Hani has features of adding friends, sending posts in the form of text, links and images, sharing,
commenting, liking posts and interacting via chat.
As well as special features for alumni in the form of campus information and job vacancies,
alumni books and alumni communities that other alumni can create and participate in.

# ðŸ“‹ About Project

This project is also a development of the previous project [hani-web](https://github.com/IlhamriSKY/Hani-halo-alumni-Web)
by using a new platform in the form of a web, it hoped that this project can be used properly,
of course there is still much to be developed to meet all these needs,
